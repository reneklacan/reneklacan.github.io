My Linux journey started during first year of high school when I heard about it and was wondering how it is different from Windows. I didn’t even had a internet connection so I had to convince my friend with amazing DSL internet to download an ISO of Mandriva Linux for me. Installed it on my Pentium D as soon as I burned it and I started exploring secrets of Linux. I found out that I have nothing to do because I wasn’t able to install any game and sound was working just randomly. I was also very bothered by fact that my home folder was being constantly filled with some weird files and folders starting with dot so deleted them every time I had a chance. I also had an issue with my configurations reseting back to defaults. Who knows why? So I returned back to Windows.

Two years after my first experience I heard about Ubuntu. This time I even had super fast 256 kbps internet so I decided to give Linux a try again. Sound was still working very unpredictable but I found out what are dot directories and files good for and I also found Wine and downloaded sources and it took me only few days to figure out how to compile it and after that I was also able to run some Windows programs! For money I was saving for a really long time I bought C++ Primer Plus book from Stephen Prata and it was the beginning of my programming future. I didn’t do lot of useful stuff then and I returned back to Windows after few weeks.

I returned back to Ubuntu few times after that but it was always just for a very short time.

The real breakthrough happened during the first year of university. I was doing some real coding and I started enjoying terminal and I didn’t even see point in playing games. I became comfortable with lot of stuff and started thinking about experimenting with different distributions. Tried lot of them and I switched to Arch Linux with Gnome. I loved how minimalistic it is and I was forced to learn lot of stuff, it was amazing. I fell in love with it’s minimalistic approach, I even switched to XFCE and then to OpenBox to have as lightweight environment as possible.

One day my friend told me about wonderful world of Gentoo and it sounded very interesting. Later on I did a few experiments in VirtualBox and decided that I want to move simplicity of my OS to the next level so I asked my friend if he can help me with installing Gentoo on my machine. He showed me how to setup custom kernel and install just necessary modules and thanks to him I learned a lot. Then I started exploring Gentoo world on my own – compilations, use flags, configurations, etc. Everyday I learned something new, it was very satisfying. I installed Gentoo even on my server. Same friend who brought my attention to Gentoo then told me about Awesome Window Manager, on first look it was really similar to OpenBox but after I tried it I found out that it’s different a lot and also a lot better.

Awesome WM was exactly what I was missing in my Linux life. So many amazing features – window tagging, tiling, powerful LUA configuration and everything is just taking few MBs of memory. Codebase is also very simple and clean and it has just few thousands of lines in C.

I stayed with Gentoo + Awesome WM for a long time and I was able to be very productive. Thanks to minimalistic kernel, tweaked use flags and Awesome WM the speed of my system was just amazing, even if it had just ordinary 7200 RPM HDD it felt as fast as any machine with SSD. I would recommend this combination to everybody.

But recently when I started working at Reevoo I was forced to make a transition to MacOS as everybody in the office is on it. I heard lot of good things about MacOS from my friends so I looked forward to it.

Today after more then 2 months on MacOS I still don’t feel as productive as I felt on my Awesome Gentoo but I am getting into that. I find very useful using [Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com/) that is making windows interactions without mouse very easy. To maximise my productivity I contributed to Spectacle with [window tagging feature](https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle/pull/302), now I’m able to have a very similar workflow as I had on my Awesome Linux. I find very surprising that my previous OS feels still swifter then MacOS (250€ lenovo vs 2000€ macbook pro).

As I was not using my Gentoo machine anymore I recently formatted it and installed Windows so I can give it to my girlfriend. Good bye Gentoo. At least for now.
